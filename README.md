# USA visa refusal rate and other components by countries 2014
## Conducted a comprehensive geospatial analysis of US visa refusal rates using data extracted from US State Department sources. The project involved creating custom datasets from multiple web sources and performing multivariate correlation analysis to identify socioeconomic factors influencing visa approval patterns.
• Developed an automated data extraction methodology to compile visa refusal statistics from official US State Department PDF documents and online sources

• Created a comprehensive dataset integrating visa refusal rates with multiple socioeconomic indicators, including GDP growth rate, population density, unemployment rate, crime statistics, literacy rates, and cost of living indices

• Implemented advanced statistical correlation analysis, revealing relationships between visa refusal patterns and country-specific demographic factors

• Designed and executed geospatial visualization techniques to map global visa refusal rate distributions, enabling identification of regional patterns and trends

• Performed multivariate statistical analysis using R programming to quantify correlations between refusal rates and socioeconomic variables

• Generated interactive data visualizations, including correlation matrices, scatter plot matrices, and world map overlays showing refusal rate distributions by country
